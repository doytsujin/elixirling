<h1 id="howtocreateaxenimageforanelixirproject">How to create a Xen image for an Elixir project</h1>

<p>Elixir has Erlang underneath, all the way down. Thus an Elixir project can run
not only on a standard Erlang VM, but on its &ldquo;OS-less&rdquo; counterpart
called LING VM. LING VM is the core technology of Erlang on Xen -
<a href="http://erlangonxen.org">erlangonxen.org</a>.</p>

<p>This tutorial explains how to produce a Xen image for your Elixir project using
the free Erlang on Xen Build Service.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add a dependency on &#8216;lingex&#8217; to your mix.exs file:</p>

<p>defp deps do
 [ &#8230;
 { :lingex, github: &#8220;maximk/lingex&#8221; }
 &#8230; ]
end</p></li>
<li><p>Run mix deps.get to update your dependencies. This adds a few custom tasks
to the mix tool (lingex.build, lingex.image, and lingex.buildi_image)</p></li>
<li><p>Set lingex options. Add the following lines to your mix.exs file:</p>

<p>def project do
 [ &#8230;
 lingex_opts: [ build_host: &#8220;build.erlangonxen.org:8080&#8221;,
 username: &#8220;test&#8221;,
 password: &#8220;test&#8221; ]
 &#8230; ]
end</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally, you may register with the build service
<a href="http://build.erlangonxen.org/register">here</a> and update the credentials
accordingly. For the complete list of recognized options see the build service
documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Run mix lingex.build_image. This will archive all *.beam files of your
project and submit them to the build service.</p></li>
<li><p>The build process will complete in about 30s. An image file called &#8216;vmling&#8217;
will appear in the current directory. The file contains LING VM, your project
code and is ready to boot as a Xen guest.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A couple configuration steps are needed to automatically start the Elixir
project when the image boots. This should be covered by a separate tutorial.</p>
